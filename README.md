This is the code of my personal website/portfolio/blog, built with Eleventy.

It is based on a fork of [deventy](https://github.com/ianrose/deventy), a minimal 11ty starting point for building static websites with modern tools. Uses the CLI of each tool. Allowing a much easier upgrade path for each individual development tool.
